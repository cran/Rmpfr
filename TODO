 - Now have working  "mpfrMatrix", dim(.) <- ..; t(), %*%, crossprod()...

 -  <mpfr> %*% <mpfr>    should work like with numeric vectors
 -  <mpfr> %*% t(<mpfr>)  ditto

  Note that matrix multiplication seems too slow --> ./Savicky-matrix-mult_tst.R

 -  <mpfr>[i] & <mpfrMatrix>[i]  work
    but   <mpfrMatrix> [i,j]  not yet

 -->  want things to work like
          which(<mpfrMatrix> == ., arr.ind = TRUE)  - ok
          outer(....)                               - not yet

 [No longer sure if this is true :]
 For this, we must ensure that the methods are used, instead of the
 .Primitive  base functions :

 One way: --> see ~/R/MM/NUMERICS/bessel-large-x.R
                  --------------------------------

  ## really interesting is  bI(x., nu)  {for "mpfr" argument}:
  ## it uses outer(), but that needs to dispatch on, e.g. "^",
  ## i.e., not only look at "base"
  environment(outer) <- as.environment("package:Rmpfr")
  environment(dim) <- as.environment("package:Rmpfr")
  environment(dimnames) <- as.environment("package:Rmpfr")
  environment(`dim<-`) <- as.environment("package:Rmpfr")
  environment(`dimnames<-`) <- as.environment("package:Rmpfr")
  environment(which) <- as.environment("package:Rmpfr")

5) I'd like seq() methods, but that seems currently impossible because of
   a "design infelicity" in base::seq.default  --- ???? E-mail to R-core ??
   --> R/mpfr.R

6) It is "wrong" that the class "Mnumber" also extends "character", "list";
   but it's not clear we can find better definitions, see R/AllClasses.R

7) Add tests for hypot() & atan2() to tests/special-fun-ex.R

8) round(x, .) & signif(x, .) currently return "mpfr" numbers of the same precision.
   That *looks* ugly.
   Potentially add a swith 'keepPrec = FALSE' -- i.e. by default *reduce*
   precision to "match" 'digits' argument.

9) median(mpfr(1:4, 60)) now fails, but mean(.) and quantile() both work.
   ------ The infelicity could be seen in the way namespaces work :
   median.default() calls the correct sort() on "mpfr", but calls the *wrong*
   base::mean() instead of mean() {which is S4 by then} ....
   all would be fine if  base::mean() was *already* S4 generic ....
   of course I could replace base::mean() by the S4 generic on
   package-load time, but would prefer a cleaner solution.
   ---> talk to Luke and John (and ??) about that

11) format() method for "mpfrArray" (and hence "mpfrMatrix") which nicely
    and correctly *jointly* formats and aligns  columns !
    drop0trailing is not really sensible there

13) implement the  NOT_YET  in src/Ops.c

16) psigamma(x, n)  {and  digamma(), trigamma() aliases}
    --> experiments in ~/R/MM/Pkg-ex/Rmpfr/psigamma.R )
    Note that since, MPFR 3.0.0, there is a digamma(); .. which we now interface to


50) For *complex* arithmetic, build interface to the  "MPC" library
   ---> http://www.multiprecision.org/mpc -- which is LGPL and itself
   builds on MPFR and GMP.
   Ubuntu now has 'libmpc-dev' (!)  {but there's no '*-doc' package yet;
   	      	  	       	     on nb-mm, I've installed from source
				     --> Info comes along}
  One idea: Since the names are so much in parallel, try
      to take each src/*.c file and mechanically  s/mpfr/mpc/  producing a
      mpc version of that;
      then "the same" for the R interface code.
